Preface The book has been prepared for use with the course GI 612 GIS for coastal and Marine Environment at the Institute of Marine Sciences of the University of Dar es Salaam (IMS/UDSM). The course intends to equip student with skills for capturing, storing, querying, analyzing, displaying, reporting and disseminating coastal and marine spatial data. This course introduce briefly the concept of geographical information system (GIS) and its relevancy in helping decision making in the era of digital age. What will you learn? This course has been divided into 6 lessons, taking you from the basic geospatial code to in-depth analysis of satellite images. At the end of the course you will be able to extract, process, analyze, and map geospatial data in R. You will also learn more about R and its visualization libraries. Lesson 1: Use Cases of Geospatial DataGeospatial data today is being used across sectors and has wide range of applications. The lesson covers the basics of geospatial data and how it is used in market segmentation, detection, fraud prevention, and more. The lesson gives complete understanding of the public and business use cases of geospatial data. Lesson 2: Manipulating Geospatial Data in RWhy you should use R as a GIS? The lesson starts with answering the question for you. It also includes comparison of two common R packages for geospatial analysis. It covers the fundamental geospatial operations like storing geospatial &amp; attribute data in a spatial dataframe illustrated with sample data, along with importing spatial data into R with the sf package and simplifying sf geospatial objects before plotting. Lesson 3: Creating Static Maps in RAfter learning the analysis, the lesson introduces you with visualization of geospatial data with choropleth, inset, faceted, cartogram, dot density, proportional symbols, and hexbin maps. It covers some of the most well-known R packages for creating static geospatial maps including sf, tmap, and ggplot2 Lesson 4: Creating Animated &amp; Interactive Maps in RVisualization becomes more useful with animation and interactivity that shows change over time. The lesson covers 7 different packages tmap, ggiraph, geogrid, geofacet, mapview, plotly, and leaflet  that can help you build animated and interactive maps. It also gives an overview of how to build geospatial interactive web applications with Shiny. Lesson 5: Performing Spatial Subsetting in RThe lesson gives an overview of spatial subsetting and when it may be useful, along with different topological relations. It explains how to filter the regions in data based on their relation to other regions (such as a common border, distance from a certain point, intersection, and more). Lesson 6: Exploring Raster Images in RSatellites capture complex form of geospatial data called Raster data. This lesson explains raster images, its attributes and features. It also covers plotting, cropping, and building indices on raster images, and downloading Landsat 8 data, one of the best sources of free satellite data today. Hope you enjoy taking the course and discovering more about geospatial data! Audience This book is primarily aimed at aquatic ecology, oceanography, limnology, and other fields that works with spatial and temporal aquatic and environmental data. Moreover, since the methods discussed in the book are applicable not only to aquatic data but also to many other fields that deal with spatial data, the book is also suitable for researchers and practitioners of other areas wishing to learn how to model and visualize this type of data. The book is also appropriate for postgraduate students of statistics and oceanography or other subjects with a strong statistical background. Why read this book? Geospatial health data are essential to inform public health and policy across high-, middle-, and low-income countries. These data can be used to understand the burden and geographic patterns of disease, and can help in the development of hypotheses that relate disease risk to potential demographic and environmental factors. This book shows how to apply cutting-edge statistical spatial and spatio-temporal methods on disease data to produce disease risk maps and quantify risk factors. Specifically, the book shows how to develop Bayesian hierarchical models and apply computational approaches such as INLA and SPDE to analyze data collected in areas (e.g., counties or provinces) and at particular locations by disease registries, national and regional institutes of statistics, and other organizations. These approaches allow to quantify the disease burden, understand geographic and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and measure inequalities. This book also provides the necessary tools to design and develop web-based digital applications such as disease atlases that incorporate interactive visualizations to make disease risk estimates available and accessible to a wide audience, including policymakers, researchers, health professionals, and the general public. These tools allow to explore vast amounts of data in an interactive and approachable way by means of maps, time plots, tables and other visualizations that support interactive filtering and zooming over different regions and periods of time to display the information of interest. These tools are beneficial when trying to identify information for specific regions, compare risks between populations, and understand how disease patterns have changed over time. The statistical methods and visualization techniques presented in this book are valuable to analyze a wide range of conditions including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries, and health-related behaviors, and provide policymakers with actionable information for the development and implementation of appropriate population health policies. Acknowledgments R represents an excellent tool for the analysis of spatial data. I would like to thank the R community and the developers and contributors of open-source software that enable reproducible data analysis. In particular, I would like to thank the developers of spatial packages, and the authors of ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) and sf (Pebesma 2018) for the great function they created for spatial and non-spatial data analysis and visualization. I would also like to thank the developers of leaflet (Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2019) and tmpa (Tennekes 2018) packages, which enable interactive mapping and visualization in R. Also and the creation of Shiny (Chang et al. 2020), a package that allows creation of web applications that make a difference on how information is distributed and insights are communicated. This book is written in R Markdown (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020) with bookdown (Xie 2016). I am grateful to the developers of these packages which made really easy the creation of this book. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments that greatly improved the first version of this book. I also thank my editor Ismael Kimirei and the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute for allowing to use their data in this book. I also thank the Institute of Marine Sciences of the University of Dar es Salaam for their suggestions and guidance throughout the publication process. How this book came to being The book was prepared and using R (R Core Team 2020) and bookdown (Xie 2020), a package based on Markdown syntax (Allaire et al. 2019) in Rstudio. Several other packages were also used for various task during book development. Diagrams were plotted using ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2020) and metR (Campitelli 2020) packages. The kableExtra package was used for making nicer table (Zhu 2020). Basemaps data were obtained from spData (Bivand, Nowosad, and Lovelace 2020). Demographic and economic data like population and Gross domestic Product from World Bank database were obtained through wbstats (Piburn 2020). Fish landings catches were obtained from rfisheries (Ram, Boettiger, and Dyck 2016). Oceanographic data were obtained from various sources and color used for mapping their distribution were obtained from oce package (Kelley and Richards 2020). The webex package was used to create the interactive web exercises (Barr and DeBruine 2019). All of this packages and software are free and open source. About the author Masumbuko Semba works at the School of Material, Energy, Water and Environment of the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology located in Arusha, Tanzania. Semba received his bachelors in fisheries and aquaculture and his master of marine sciences from the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Semba is current doing a PhD in the department of physical oceanography at the Institute of Marine Sciences of the University of Dar es Salaam. Semba research focuses on understanding the surface current dynamics using drifter observations and satellite altimetry data to understand how ocean current in the Indian Ocean vary both in space and time. Semba holds extensive analytic skills using different programming languages including MATLAB, Python and R. His keen interest in coding resulted from power of programming in analytic skills and ability to glean insights from data. Understanding a difficult facing scientist to analyse the data with programming, he developed a blog where he share his analytic concepts to the public. Semba has developed several data web-application that serve as data repository and exploration tool for Lake Tanganyika and Indian Ocean. These web application provide a platform to analyse marine and freshwater environmental data that vary both in space and time. Semba is active developing a package that is dedicated for marine and freshwater system in the WIO region. The packages is basically developed to help marine and freshwater scientist access a large and varied format of in-situ and satellite data in easy way.
